# Tyler The Creator 2021 Tour 

This will be a fan-made website about artist - Tyler The Creators Tour. The website will show his tour dates, tour photos aswell as give links to his various music, social and merchandise sites.

## UX
 
This website is intended for men and women aged between 18 and 35. It will mainly appeal to Tyler The Creator fanbase who are already very familiar with him and are keen to find out tour dates.

I want users to be able to achieve several things when using the website.
* I want it to be user friendly and easy to understand and navigate.
* I want it to be clear to the users that the purpose of this website is to buy tickets to his website. 
* Have links to his albums by linking external music streaming services such as spotify.
* Being able to have an idea what the experience would be like to see this artist in concert by adding photos of the tour.
* The website design should be simple to try and not overwhelm the user with too many options.

## User Stories

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

## Wireframes

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Features


 
### Existing Features
- **NAVBAR:** I used BOOTSTRAP to make this. I chose this as it is easy to understand for the user and they can easily recognise which page they are on. 
- **TOUR-DATES:** I used a BOOTSTRAP list for this. 
- **TOUR PHOTOS:**

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- A feedback form in order for users to contact me to give feedback on further artist updates

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap** to create various parts of the website include the header, footer, tour dates and a grid system
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome** for the icons at the footer of the pages.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
